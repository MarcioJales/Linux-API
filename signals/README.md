| sig_ign.c  | Exercise 2 from chapter 20 |

## Chapter 20, exercise 1

Tested with the same examples from the book.

## Chapter 20, exercise 2

We use much of the structure from `sig_receiver.c` to create the program. Thus, in order to compile it, I've added `sig_ign.c` to directory where the book's applications are and its Makefile.
